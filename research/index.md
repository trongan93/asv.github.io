AeroSat Vision Lab 致力於神經網路、電腦視覺與遙測技術在航太與衛星應用領域的前瞻研究。我們專注於太空載具之人工智慧自主系統開發，特別是以 OrbitAI 為核心的嵌入式 AI 平台。透過深度學習、低功耗運算與感測器融合，我們正引領軌道上智慧系統的創新。

AeroSat Vision Lab is dedicated to advancing the frontiers of neural networks, computer vision, and remote sensing in aerospace and satellite domains. We focus on AI-driven autonomy for spacecraft systems, particularly through the development of onboard platforms like OrbitAI. By combining deep learning, embedded computing, and space-grade sensor integration, our research aims to redefine how intelligent systems operate in orbit.
