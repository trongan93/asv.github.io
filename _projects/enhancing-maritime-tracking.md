This project focuses on **real-time maritime object tracking** using Edge AI and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. While the overarching vision involves satellite-based processing, the **current development and testing are centered on UAV platforms**. Specifically, the project involves:

- **Processing remote sensing data with AI models on UAVs** to simulate future satellite integration.
- **Tracking maritime activities in the Taiwan Strait** using onboard Edge AI for real-time ship detection and classification.
- **Developing and testing a UAV-based communication network** to validate architecture and data transmission strategies planned for eventual LEO satellite deployment.

> üõ†Ô∏è *Note:* Satellite systems are not included in the testing phase or KPIs of the current project cycle. UAVs serve as a testbed for core AI and communication technologies that will later scale to satellite applications.

## üìù Midterm Report (as of May 2025)

### 1. Project Overview

This collaborative research project aims to enhance maritime object tracking using Edge AI and deep reinforcement learning technologies. Although the long-term vision includes **satellite-based AI processing**, the **current phase is focused exclusively on UAV-based implementation and validation**.

### 2. Objectives

1. **Implement Edge AI on UAV platforms** to enable real-time processing of remote sensing data for ship detection and tracking.  
2. **Develop a UAV-based communication network** to ensure efficient and reliable data transmission between UAVs and ground stations.  
3. Lay the groundwork for eventual integration with satellite systems through UAV-based testing of algorithms, models, and network behavior.

### 3. Scope Clarification

While the project title references satellite-based tracking, all **development, integration, and validation** during this project period are performed using **UAV platforms only**. Satellites are not involved in hardware or system testing in this phase.

### 4. Progress Highlights

- ‚úÖ **Edge AI Deployment on UAVs**: Onboard object detection models (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet) successfully integrated on embedded GPU platforms.
- ‚úÖ **Scenario Modeling**: Simulated maritime activity and environmental data over the Taiwan Strait used to train AI models.
- üîÑ **UAV Communication Prototyping**: UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground communication protocols prototyped and tested under various network topologies.
- üîÑ **Reinforcement Learning Development**: Initial RL policies under training to manage UAV routing and communication optimization.

### 5. Next Steps

- Conduct **multi-UAV flight tests** to validate full AI + communication system pipeline.
- Optimize **model efficiency** for edge hardware (compute, power, bandwidth).
- Expand and evaluate reinforcement learning performance under more complex environmental dynamics.

### 6. Summary

Although satellites are a long-term integration target, this project cycle uses UAVs as a practical test platform to build, test, and refine AI and communication technologies needed for real-time maritime monitoring in the Taiwan Strait. The outcomes will directly support scalable transition to LEO satellite-based systems in future phases.
