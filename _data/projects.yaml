  description: This research aims to develop a semi-supervised learning model that reconstructs disaster-affected areas obscured by cloud cover. By integrating this model into edge computing devices onboard satellites, the project seeks to enhance real-time disaster detection and prediction capabilities. A key innovation of this research is its implementation in a CanSAT, a small satellite platform, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time disaster monitoring in space.
