# 🎊 Happy Lunar New Year to My Dear Colleagues! 🎊
Wishing everyone happiness, prosperity, and success in the year ahead! 🏮🐉✨

Excited to start this year with new publication and an open-source contribution! 💻

## 🚀 Solving a Major Challenge in Satellite Imaging! 🛰️
One of the biggest challenges in satellite imaging is handling extreme variations in brightness within a single frame. 🌍

### 📌 The Problem:
Satellite images often contain regions that are too dark (shaded areas, forests, water bodies) or too bright (snow, clouds, deserts) due to environmental conditions. Traditional enhancement methods often overexpose bright areas while trying to enhance darker regions, leading to loss of crucial details.

### 💡 Our Solution: RoIDE (Region of Interest-Focused Dynamic Enhancement)
Our latest research, published in **IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing**, sponsored by **IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS)**, introduces RoIDE, a deep learning-based enhancement framework that:
- ✅ Generates multi-exposure images from a single satellite image
- ✅ Dynamically fuses exposures to enhance regions of interest (RoI)
- ✅ Preserves details in both dark and bright areas without overexposure

### 💻 Open-Source Code Now Available!
To support the research community, I’ve made our RoIDE implementation open-source:  
🔗 **My GitHub Repository**: [https://lnkd.in/gsEAY3Ap](https://lnkd.in/gsEAY3Ap)  
📥 **Dataset**: Available on Zenodo with DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14792938 [https://lnkd.in/gn-z62mg](https://lnkd.in/gn-z62mg)

### Why This Matters
From disaster response to urban planning, having clearer and more balanced satellite images can drastically improve decision-making. Our approach allows for better object detection, climate analysis, and environmental monitoring without introducing artifacts or distortions.
