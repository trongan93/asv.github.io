## Enhancing EMI Teaching with Support from Penn State Advisors


I would like to sincerely thank the two EMI (English as a Medium of Instruction) advisors from The Pennsylvania State University, USAâ€”Jacob Rieker, PhD and Meredith Doranâ€”for their invaluable one-on-one coaching sessions throughout the entire semester, which greatly enhanced my teaching of the course:

ðŸŽ“ Mission and System Design, Verification and Validation https://istudy.ntut.edu.tw/info/10096524
ðŸ“˜ A required course for graduate students at the Institute of Aerospace and System Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology.

With their expert guidance, I learned how to create more engaging classroom activities and help students stay focused and actively involved. The EMI coaching encouraged me to reflect deeply on my teaching approach and redesign a more effective and inclusive learning environment for local students in an EMI setting.

This experience has been truly transformative in my journey. Iâ€™m also honored to have received the EMI Certificate of Innovation in recognition of this professional development.

A heartfelt thank you once again to Dr. Rieker and Doranâ€”your support has made a lasting impact on my teaching and my students.
