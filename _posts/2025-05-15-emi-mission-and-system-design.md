## Enhancing EMI Teaching with Support from Penn State Advisors

![EMI Coaching Session at NTUT](images/blogs/DSC07080_compressed.jpg)

We are deeply grateful to the two EMI (English as a Medium of Instruction) advisors from The Pennsylvania State University, USAâ€”**Dr. Jacob Rieker** and **Dr. Meredith Doran**â€”for their dedicated one-on-one coaching sessions throughout the semester. Their expert support significantly enhanced the quality and delivery of our graduate-level course:

> ðŸŽ“ [Mission and System Design, Verification and Validation](https://istudy.ntut.edu.tw/info/10096524)  
> ðŸ“˜ A core course for graduate students at the Institute of Aerospace and System Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT)

Through their coaching, we learned how to design more engaging classroom activities and promote active student participation. Their guidance encouraged a deeper reflection on our teaching methods and inspired a more inclusive, learner-centered EMI environment tailored to local students.

This professional development experience was truly transformative. We're honored to have received the **EMI Certificate of Innovation**, recognizing our growth and commitment to instructional excellence.

A heartfelt thank you once again to Dr. Rieker and Dr. Doranâ€”your mentorship has made a lasting impact on both our teaching and our studentsâ€™ learning journey.
